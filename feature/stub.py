"""
A feature stub can be thought as the "blueprint" of the features.

Recall that one particular feature dimension is described as:
    * Channel Number
    * X coordinate of upperleft point of the box
    * Y coordinate of upperleft point of the box
    * Height
    * Width

A feature is essentially a 5-tuple, carrying the information given above. This module is concerned with generation,
serialization and deserialization of these feature tuples.
